The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes cause unexpected behavior if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage.  For example, if you try to use `calc(100% - 50px)` within a nested element that has its own percentage-based width, the calculation might not behave as intuitively expected due to the way percentage values are resolved relative to their containing element.
